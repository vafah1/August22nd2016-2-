<body style="color: blue">The York Generals is a Semi-Pro football team located in York, PA.The team practices and plays at Allen Field, located across the
street from the A Plus Gas Station on Sherman Avenue. The team recently faced a devastating personal loss last week.
Shannon Martin, a team mate and brother as well as integral part of the team's defense, was found dead on the side of the road 
off of exit 8 (Glen Rock) on I-83. His body was dumped there by the individuals who commited this heinous crime. This tragic event has affected the entire city and has sparked a movement to stop the violence that is plaguing the young men of York. This season will be dedicated to the memory of Shannon and other young men whose lives were cut down way too short. There will be activities held every weekend to provide the youths of the city the opportunity to become involved in team sports and be exposed to mentorship by players and coaches alike.
